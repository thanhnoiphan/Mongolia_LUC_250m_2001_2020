## Mongolia_LUC_250m_2001_2020

Several studies have reported inconsistencies among global land cover (GLC) products causing that the accuracy of these products differ between regions. Recently, this issue has received a new level of attention, because many studies have pointed out that the inaccuracy of land cover products at regional scale can make a huge impact on the results of other applications relying on the GLC products (in the following downstream applications). Therefore, developing a method which can be easily and quickly applied to many different regions, but produce highly accurate land cover information is of utmost importance. To meet the first two criteria, several studies successfully used existing GLC products to automatically generate samples. However, none of these studies have been focused on the quality of the samples, which directly and largely affect the classification results. In this context, and taking Mongolia as a case study, we proposed a simple, fast, and accurate method to produce annual land cover maps with 250 m spatial resolution for entire Mongolia over a period of 20 years, from 2001 to 2020. 

The overview of the study is shown in the figure below: <br>

### Data description: 
The land cover maps have 6 classes (land cover types): <br> 
| Land Cover Types | Code | 
|------------------|------| 
| Water | 0 | 
| Forest | 1 | 
| Shrub land | 2 | 
| Grassland | 3 | 
| Others | 4| 
| Bare land | 5 |
